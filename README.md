# Simple-Linear-Regression
 
 In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. The purpose of linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.

# How to calculate simple linear regression

The formula for simple linear regression is Y = mX + b, where Y is the response (dependent) variable, X is the predictor (independent) variable, m is the estimated slope, and b is the estimated intercept. Let say here in this Salary Dataset we can predict the salary by giving the number of experince to the machine but for that we have to train the machine on 60%, 70% or 80% of the dataset in order to get the prediction.

# Steps to do a Simple Linear Regression
#### Step-1 Import libraries and dataset
#### Step-2 Splitting dataset into training & testing data
#### Step-3 Fit linear regression model
#### Step-4 Plotting
#### Step-5 Testing or evaluting your model
#### Step-6 Prediction of unknown values
#### Step-7 Chekc mean squared error and R2 score
#### Step-8 Intercepts and coeffecients
